# only.
#
# If you would like to accept traffic from all interface, just remove
# this option.
#
# Default:
#	Listen on all interfaces


# Option: Port
# Syntax:
#	Port	port_num|service
#
# Set the FTP port for listening connections. When -D (daemon mode)
# is specified, accept connections at port, specified as a numeric
# value or service name, instead of at the default ``ftp'' port.
#
# Default:
#	Port ftp
#Port	21

# Option: Umask

# The pid file for ftp daemon. When using daemon mode, the ftp daemon
# will write it's pid to pid file if set.
#
# Default: None (don't write pid)
PidFile			"/var/run/smbftpd.pid"

# Option: DebugMode
# Syntax:
#	DebugMode	Yes|No
#
# Log more information for debug.
#
# Default:
#	DebugMode	No

# Option: LogCommand
# Syntax:
#	LogCommand	Yes|No
#
# Each successful and failed ftp(1) session is logged using syslog
# with a facility of LOG_FTP.  If this option is set to "Yes",
# the retrieve (get), store (put), append, delete, make directory,
# remove directory and rename operations and their filename argu-

#
# Disable the EPSV command.  This is useful for servers behind
# older firewalls.
#
# Default:
#	DisableEPSV	No

# Option: RestrictedPorts
# Syntax:
#	RestrictedPorts	Yes|No
#
# With this option set, ftpd will revert to historical behavior
# with regard to security checks on user operations and restric-
# tions on PORT requests. Currently, ftpd will only honor PORT
# commands directed to unprivileged ports (normally >1024) on
# the remote user's host (which violates the FTP protocol 
# specification but closes some security holes).
#
# Default:
#	RestrictedPorts Yes

# Option: PassiveModePortRange
# Syntax:
#	PassiveModePortRange	low-high
#
# Set the port range used in passive mode data connection. If your
# FTP server is behind NAT, you might want to forward passive mode
# port range on router.
#
# For example, if you would like to use port range 40000 to 50000:
#	PassiveModePortRange	40000-50000
#
# The range should be >=1024 and <=65535 (1023 < range < 65536)
# Default: Not set

# Option: ForcePassiveIP
# Syntax:
#	ForcePassiveIP  ip|hostname
#
# If your FTP server is behind NAT, when using passive mode, the FTP
# server will report internal ip (e.g. 192.168.x.x) to client. Some
# FTP client(e.g. Filezilla 2) can't handle this well and will try
# to connect the to 192.168.x.x.
#
# You can fix this by setting the ForcePassiveIP. We will use this
# IP in Passive Mode. If your external IP will be changed every a
# while, you can use ddns and write the hostname here.
#
# For example:
#	ForcePassiveIP	alexwang.ddns.org
#	  or
#	ForcePassiveIP	220.132.243.97
#
# Default: Not set

# Syntax:
#	MaxConnection	number
#
# This option allows the number of simultaneous connections to a
# service to be limited. If max connections is greater than 0 then
# connections will be refused if this number of connections to the
# service are already open. A value of zero mean an unlimited number
# of connections may be made.
#
# Default:
#	MaxConnection	0 (unlimited)

# Option: MaxConnectionPerIP
# Syntax:
#	MaxConnection	number
#
# This option set the max connection per ip address. To use this option,
# you must set the MaxConnection, too.
#
# Set the value less then 2 is not recommended because many FTP clients
# open more then 1 connection in signle session.
#
# Default:
#	MaxConnectionPerIP	0 (unlimited)

# Option: VirtualUserMapping
# Syntax:
#	VirtualUserMapping  username
#
# If you do not want to use real system user in the FTP, you have to
# ask SmbFTPD to:
#   1. Read user/password from somewhere else. (set VirtualUserAuthMethod)
#   2. After pass authentication, map the user to a real user in the
#      system. The real user will be the owner when file is uploaded.
#      The option VirtualUserMapping is used to specify the real user.
#
# For example, you can MySQL for user/password authentication. After
# user login, we can map the user to "ftp" user. So the file uploaded
# by the user will be owned by "ftp".
#
# Please note that you have to set VirtualUserAuthMethod and
# VirtualUserAuthConfig if you enable VirtualUserMapping.
#
# Default: No mapping

# Option: VirtualUserAuthMethod
# Syntax:
#	VirtualUserAuthMethod	mysql|pgsql|text
#
# The authentication method to use for virtual user login. You can
# user "mysql", "pgsql", or "text". You would have to set the
# VirtualUserAuthConfig to specify the path of auth method config.
#
# If you want to use text file to store user, you can use "smbftpd-user"
# to add/delete/edit
#       user.
#
# Default: Not set

# Option: VirtualUserAuthConfig
# Syntax:
#	VirtualUserAuthConfig	/path/to/the/VirtualUserAuthMethod.conf
#
# The config file for the VirtualUserAuthMethod. For example, if you use MySQL:
#	VirtualUserAuthConfig    /usr/local/etc/smbftpd/smbftpd_mysql.conf
# If you use PostgreSQL:
#	VirtualUserAuthConfig    /usr/local/etc/smbftpd/smbftpd_pgsql.conf
# If you use text file:
#	VirtualUserAuthConfig    /usr/local/etc/smbftpd/smbftpd_user.conf
# If you use text file to store virtual users, you can use the command
# "smbftpd-user" to create/edit/delete users.
#
# Default: Not set

# Option: RequireValidShell
# Syntax:
#	RequireValidShell	Yes|No
#
# When RequireValidShare=Yes, The user must have a standard shell
# returned by getusershell(3). In most system, the valid shells
# will appear in /etc/shells.
#
# Default: Yes

# The arguments for NoLoginList can be one of the following format:
#   1. A user/@group string list. When using group, please add an prefix '@'.
#   2. A absolute path to a file that contains no login user/@group.
#   3. Minimum UID allowed. Users whose uid < MinUID is not allowed.
#
# If using a string list, separate multi users/groups by ",".
#     For example: user1, user2, @group1, @group2, user3
#
# If using file, each user/group is a new line. For example, you can
# create a file named /etc/ftpusers which has the following content:
#
#           user1
#           user2
#           @group1
#           @group2

# 	MaxTimeOut 7200

# =========================== FTP folder control ===========================
# Option: DefaultMode
# Syntax:
#	DefaultMode SMB|Normal
#
# There are two modes. The SMB mode or Normal mode. The smbftpd will
# use the share access rights in smb.conf under SMB mode. On the 
# contrary, it will be normal FTP daemon under the Normal mode.
#
# Default:
#	DefaultMode	Normal

# Option: ExceptionList
# Syntax:
#	ExceptionList	user1,user2,@group1,@group2...
#
# You can use the ExceptionList to set users/groups that do not use
# the default ftp mode that is set by DefaultMode. For example, if 
# you would like to use SMB mode for all users execpt wheel group, 
# you can set the DefaultMode to the SMB and add @wheel to the 
# ExceptionList.
#
# The arguments for ExceptionList can be user or group. When using 
# group, please add an prefix '@'. When multi users/groups, seperate
# by ","
# For example:
#	ExceptionList @group1,user1,user2,@group2
#
# Default: None ExceptionList
#ExceptionList @wheel

# Option: ShareConfPath
# Syntax:
#	ShareConfPath	/some/where/smbftpd_share.conf
#
# Set the path of share config file "smbftpd_share.conf". If DefaultMode is
# SMB or DefaultMode is Normal with ExceptionList, you must set the
# path of share config file.
#
# I will check the following keywords in share folder setting:
#   1. path: The path of share. It must be a absolute path.
#   2. rw: users/groups that have write privilege.
#   3. ro: Users/groups that have read only privilege
#   4. disable_download: users/groups that can't download file in the share.
#   5. disable_ls: users/groups that can't ls to list the files under the 
#      share.
#   6. disable_modify: users/groups that can't modify exist files. They can
#      uplaod only. Can't rename, delete, modify exist files. They can onlly
#      upload or mkdir. Notice that the user must be in "rw" list so they can
#      upload file.
#   7. browseable: does the share is visible when "ls /". So that use won't
#      know the share exists but they can still cd into the share.
#
# The option format for "path" is "path=/real/path".
# The option format for "browseable" is "browseable=[yes|no]", the default is yes
# The option format for "rw", "ro", "disable_download", "disable_ls",
# "disable_modify" is "option=user1, @group1". The prefix "@" mean group.
#
# User "ftp" and "anonymous" are anonymous users. They are mapped to real
# user "ftp". If you would like to set the permission for these two users,
# please use user "ftp".
#
# Example 1:
#   Here is an example that there is a share named "public" and the
#   path is /home/public, users in samba group have read privilege,
#   root has write privilege. Users "ftp" and "anonymous" have read
#   only privilege, too.:
#
#	[public]
#		path = /home/public
#		rw = root
#		ro = @samba, ftp
#
# Example 2:
#   Share name is private only wheel group can write, and is not
#   browseable when perform LIST in /, but you can cd to private share even
#   you can see it when ls.
#
#	[private]
#		path = /root/ftp
#		rw = @wheel
#		browseable = no
#
# Example 3:
#   A special share "homes" imply user's home directory. If you add a [homes],
#   then user will see a share named "home", the "home" is user's home 
#   directory. You may also set the browseable, disable_ls, disable_modify, 
#   disable_download on home share. If user's home directory does not exist,
#   we won't show the home share for him.
#
#   [homes]
#       browseable = yes
#       disable_download = alex
#       disable_ls = @cannot_ls_group
#
# Default: None (don't use smb mode)
#ShareConfPath	"/usr/local/etc/smbftpd/smbftpd_share.conf"

#
# Users/Groups in the list will be applied to this session by 
# changing its root directory with chroot(2) to that specified on the
# "path".
#
# The first field specifies a user or group name.  If it is prefixed
# by an ``at'' sign, `@', it specifies a group name; the line will 
# match each user who is a member of this group.  As a special case,
# a single `@' in this field will match any user.  A username is 
# specified otherwise.
#
# Notice: 
#      1. The chrooted users will use Normal mode rather then SMB
#         mode even they are set to use SMB mode. See option 
#         "DefaultMode".
#      2. Anonymous User will always chroot if it is not using SMB
#         mode.
#
# Here are some examples:
# 1. Members in "ftpgroup" group would be changed root directory to 
#    their home directory.
#
#        ChrootSet @ftpgroup	~
#
# 2. Members of "webusers" group would be changed root directory to
#    the "public_html" directory under their home directory, thus 
#    lowering possible impact on the system from intrinsic insecurity
#    of FTP.
#
#        ChrootSet @webusers	~/public_html
#
# 3. All users (a single `@') will be chroot to their home directory.

#
# If you enable SupportUTF8Client, we will tell client this FTP server
# supports UTF-8. The client can choose to use UTF-8 or not by sending
# the OPTS UTF8 command.

# You would have to set the CharsetEncoding. We will use the encoding
# to convert UTF-8 to codepage or codepage to UTF8.
#
# Default:
#	SupportUTF8Client	No

# Options: UsingUTF8FileSystem
# Syntax:
#	UsingUTF8FileSystem		Yes|No

#
# If client is using non-UTF-8 FTP but our filesystem is UTF-8, we
# have to do some filename conversion.
#
# You would have to set the CharsetEncoding. We will use the encoding
# to convert UTF-8 to codepage or codepage to UTF8.
#
# Please note that your smbftpd_share.conf should be in UTF-8 format

# Option: AnonymDisableSecure
# Syntax:
#	AnonymDisableSecure Yes|No
#
# Set the AnonymDisableSecure to "Yes" if you would like to disable the
